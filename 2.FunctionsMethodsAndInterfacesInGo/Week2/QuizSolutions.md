1. Is the highlighted assignment to f in the following code a legal variable assignment?

The variable `f` is assigned to a function, taking a string as argument and returning an integer.

2. Which of the following statements correctly declares a function whose argument is another function which takes an integer as an argument and returns a string?

As one can see, `fA` takes as argument a function `fB`, whose argument is an integer and returns a string.

3. What is an anonymous function?

Simply a function with no explicit name.

4. Which of the following statements correctly declares a function whose return value is another function which takes a string as an argument and returns an integer?

The function `fA` takes as argument the function `fB` (whose properties we can neglect for this question) and returns another function whose argument is a string and returns an integer.

_Note_: This question will be marked as incorrect as there is a mistake in Coursera quiz. (Many others and) I reported this both in Coursera contact form than in weekly discussion forums, but at the moment no one corrected this.

5. What does the above code print on the screen?

This question is about function environments.
Indeed, when you assign `fB` to `fA` you first initialise `i` to zero, then you return `func()` to `fB`.
Hence, you call `fB` twice, meaning calling `func()`.
Thus first returning `i = 1`, then `i = 2`.

6. What symbols are used in a function declaration to indicate that it is a variadic function?

![](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/49638680/91836323-e3b13d00-ec4a-11ea-931f-3a7a4bdc2764.png)

Variadic functions, with a variable number of arguments are indicated by the three dots, `...`.

7. What does this routine produce?

_Note the typo, the routine so written produces an error. By correcting the typo (`I` -> `i`), you get the correct answer `123`._

At line `7`, you assign the value 1 to the variable `i` and print it, so the first digit is `1`.
Then you increase the value stored in `i` by one, and you evaluate `i+1` (=3) and pass it to the deferred call of `Print`.
At this stage the `fmt.Print(i)` is executed and so the second digit is `2`.
Finally the deferred instruction can be executed, printint the last digit, _i.e._ `3`.
