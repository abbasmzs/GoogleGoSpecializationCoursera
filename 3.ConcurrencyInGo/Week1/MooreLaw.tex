\section*{Moore's Law}
Moore's law is the observation that the number of transistors in a dense integrated circuit doubles about every two years.
This law -- which is more an observation and projection of a historical trend -- is named after George Moore, the co-founder of Fairchild Semiconductor and CEO and co-founder of Intel, who in 1965 posited a doubling every year in the number of components per integrated circuit, and projected this rate of growth would continue for at least another decade.
As said, rather than a law of physics, it is an empirical relationship linked to gains from experience in production.

\section*{Introduction}
Moore's law is the observation that the number of transistors in a dense integrated circuit doubles about every two years.
This law -- which is more an observation and projection of a historical trend -- is named after George Moore, the co-founder of Fairchild Semiconductor and CEO and co-founder of Intel, who in 1965 posited a doubling every year in the number of components per integrated circuit, and projected this rate of growth would continue for at least another decade.
In 1975, looking forward to the next decade, he revised the forecast to doubling every two years.
As said, rather than a law of physics, it is an empirical relationship linked to gains from experience in production.

\section*{Limits}
Although the rate held steady from 1975 until around 2012, the rate was faster during the first decade.
In general, it is not logically sound to extrapolate from the historical growth rate into the indefinite future.
For instance, the 2010 update to the \emph{International Technology Roadmap for Semiconductors} predicted that growth would slow around 2013, and in 2015 the same Gordon Moore foresaw that the rate of progress would reach saturation:

\begin{displayquote}
  I see Moore's law dying here in the next decade or so.
\end{displayquote}

\subsection*{Reason of the end of Moore's law}
One can list the several reasons at the root of the end of Moore's law:

\begin{enumerate}
\item As transistors increase, power demand increases, which
increases heat.
\item Smaller transistors switch faster, increasing power demand.
\item Exponential increase in density would lead to
exponential increase in speed
\item Transistorâ€™s need a minimum voltage to switch, and
voltage reduction has lower limits due to noise.
\item Dynamic power consumption is reduced by voltage
scaling.
\item Voltage scaling does not prevent power leakage.
\end{enumerate}

\end{figure}

\section*{conclusions}
As said in the beginning, Moore's law is not a physical law.
It was just an extrapolation of a trend, only true in a very specific moment of time.
A good programmer should not base the good performances of its softwares only on hardware capacity.
