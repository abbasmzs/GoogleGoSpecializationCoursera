/*
Write a program to implement the dining philosopher’s problem with the following
constraints/modifications.

1. There should be 5 philosophers sharing chopsticks, with one chopstick between
each adjacent pair of philosophers.
2. Each philosopher should eat only 3 times (not in an infinite loop as we did
in lecture).
3. The philosophers pick up the chopsticks in any order, not lowest-numbered
first (which we did in lecture).
4. In order to eat, a philosopher must get permission from a host which executes
in its own goroutine.
5. The host allows no more than 2 philosophers to eat concurrently.
6. Each philosopher is numbered, 1 through 5.
7. When a philosopher starts eating (after it has obtained necessary locks) it
prints “starting to eat <number>” on a line by itself, where <number> is the
number of the philosopher.
8. When a philosopher finishes eating (before it has released its locks) it
prints “finishing eating <number>” on a line by itself, where <number> is the
number of the philosopher.

A detailed explanation of the problem can be found at this link
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dining_philosophers_problem.

Here we implement the so-called arbitrator solution of the problem, introducing
a central authority (the host) to determine the chopstick picking order.

// Script to implement the dining philosopher's problem.

// We implemented all as parametric as possible, so we only need to give a list
// of names and change a set of global variables to change the number and the
// identity of philosophers.

// The host is the one giving permission to eat.
// In this implementation is the arbitrator choosing the picking order of
// chopsticks.
// It has two attributes: a channel to communicate with philosophers and the
