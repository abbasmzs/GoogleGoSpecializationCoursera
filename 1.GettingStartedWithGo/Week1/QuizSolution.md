The compiler is a program translating instructions written in higher level language into machine language. It does once and before the execution of the code.

2. What is the scope of a variable?

The __scope__ of a variable is the region of a program in which the variable is visible, _i.e._, in which it is accessible by its name and can be used.

3. What is _garbage collection_?

It is the mechanism (in GO language) taking care of memory de-allocation. _i.e._ when memory can be de-allocated for objects no longer in use.

4. What does an interpreter do?

An interpreter translate the code instructions of an _interpreted language_ into machine language while executing them.

5. Concurrency always results in some performance improvement.

This is false because concurrency is not enough. To make a code parallel, you need to provide hardware (multiple cores).

6. The type of a variable determines which of the following aspects of that variable?

It determines the allowed value of the variable (an integer cannot allocate 3.141592654 as a value.) It determines allowed operations (you cannot divide one string for another). Finally it determines the memory sized to be allocated for that variable (think of the shape of an array).

7. What is the name for the package from which an executable is generated?

8. Which of the following is an example of _short variable declaration_?
