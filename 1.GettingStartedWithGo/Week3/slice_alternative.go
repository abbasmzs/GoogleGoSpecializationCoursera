/*
Write a program which prompts the user to enter integers and stores
the integers in a sorted slice.
The program should be written as a loop.
Before entering the loop, the program should create an empty integer slice
of size (length) 3.
During each pass through the loop, the program prompts the user to enter
an integer to be added to the slice.
The program adds the integer to the slice, sorts the slice, and prints
the contents of the slice in sorted order.
The slice must grow in size to accommodate any number of integers
which the user decides to enter.
The program should only quit (exiting the loop) when the user enters
the character ‘X’ instead of an integer.
